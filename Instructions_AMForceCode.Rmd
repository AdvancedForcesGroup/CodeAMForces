*IMPORTANT: To test code Go straight to step 2 below*

# INSTRUCTIONS 

##  Place all your txt files into ION folder inside Statistics folder. 

## Run the Main code:

Code_2014 inside the Code_2014 in folder, i.e. Force_Dissipation_2013March17.m, and choose folder where text files
are, i.e. the ION folder inside the Statistics folder.  

* Note: To test the code leave the AFM_1.txt file in and choose the folder ION when you run the code. 

## GET Statistic (Conservative part and optional) 

- When the folders are done place folder from ION folder into folder inside it called 20131225 48h (historical reasons!)
 

- Run the FiguresProcessing.m instide Statistics for conservative data in long range:

You will get a matrix, ResulrMat with three columns:

* Fadhesion, i.e. related to chemical affinity and capilarity

* Area under the curve, i.e. work required to separate tip from sample

* The distance IncrFad, i.e. related to the height of water layers

For details on, and definitions of, the meaning of the above parameters check:

### **Elastic Modulus**:

Run AveragesElasticity.m inside the Code_2014 folder
This generates statistics also for Elastic Modulus.

You will get a histogram and a box plot.
